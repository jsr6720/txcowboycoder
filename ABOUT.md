## About

Currently I develop with 4D, PHP, Flex, ruby, python, java and anything else that can solve my problems. I started this blog to write about 4D. Don’t worry if you’ve never heard of 4th Dimension proprietary database software, you’re not alone.

Most, if not all, of my posts are the results of on-the-job problem solving. I’d be happy to join you on your problem solving adventures; just drop me a line.

I started this blog before I became aware of the negative connotations of being a ‘cowboy’ coder. I pursue the highest coding standards possible working with a set of principles to guide my work.

I have found in my work experience, many hours of frustration and headache can be solved by just a few lines of example code.

Consider the following applied to any and all source code found on this site unless otherwise explicitly noted. I offer my code freely to the world, and in an effort to conserve space in posted code I’m including the standard MIT license here.

## Resources

Below a collection of tools that I can’t always keep straight, but I like to use from time to time.

4D
- Pluggers Software – be sure to check out the free API pack
- Reflector – similar functionality to 4D insider. site has other free tools as well
