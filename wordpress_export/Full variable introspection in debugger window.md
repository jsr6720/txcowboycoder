# Full variable introspection in debugger window

Another pet peeve. When developing in 4D I canâ€™t see past 254 characters in
the debugger window.

So I have to either ` Alert($some_really_long_string) ` or write the data to
file. Annoying.

Maybe I should start a twitter account for these minute frustrations.
