# Lack of proofing will always mean bad english

Not that I can pretend I’m perfect, nor am I a ‘grammar nazi’. However nothing
says ‘unprofessional work done in a hurry’ than egregious spelling errors.

The majority of the time I see these errors on major news websites. This isn’t
the focus of my writing but I need a forum for expressing my frustration.

Sometimes it’s not the fault of the content creator, but of the CMS used on
the website.

My first example, on the main page of this major news organization’s website
is an excerpt of the article

> Virginia man who threatened creators of ‘South Park’ and tried to terror
> group faces up to 30 years in prison

So is it that he is tied to terror groups, or that he was tried for being in a
terror group?

Follow the link and the description is better

> A college dropout and Muslim convert who threatened the creators of the
> “South Park” cartoon series and then tried to join an Al Qaeda-linked
> terrorist group in Somalia is facing a prison term of up to 30 years.

Ohhh.. he tried to JOIN a terror group, yea that totally makes sense now.
