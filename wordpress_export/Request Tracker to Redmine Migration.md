# Request Tracker to Redmine Migration

The last two weeks have been focused on learning ruby to write a rake task
that would migrate data from Perl based Request Tracker(TM) to a RoR based
Redmine issue tracking system.

I’m happy to report (and sad I didn’t post incremental updates on my
experiences with ruby) that I have released a beta rake task that goes 90% of
the way.

Needless to say there are countless ways this could be improved and cleaned
up. I hope that others find it useful, and I am happy to have ‘contributed’
back to the community for once.

My summary of RoR is its nice to be working in a class based, object based MVC
architecture. Don’t know if 4D will ever get there.
