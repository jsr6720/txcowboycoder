# Real programmers use the right tool for the job

I was doing some light reading via Slashdot on [ why guis suck revisited
](http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-center/why-guis-suck-revisited-515) .
Reading the endless debate about graphical interfaces versus command line is
like a political debate. Authors often frame the article to one spectrum end
or another to entice response.

The myriad of examples back up a specific view point I’m going to say
something totally uncontroversial: “real programmers use the right tool for
the job”. This post title itself being a reference to [ xkcd “Real
Programmers” ](http://xkcd.com/378/) .

Yes we all know plenty of examples where a well placed ` sed ` saved the day.
We also know when popping open an application and clicking a few buttons is
much easier than writing individual commands.

Really, how many people do you know who use ` mail ` or ` mutt ` as a command
line interface to their mail? How many people browse the internet using `
links ` ? My approach to any problem is to find the right tool to accomplish
the task. Sometimes this means going straight to the command line, other times
it means interacting with a program via a graphical interface.

Real programmers have an arsenal of tools to get the job done and can identify
the best way out of a problem.
