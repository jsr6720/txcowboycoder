# Postgres dynamic trigger â€” mirroring

This is a companion post to the [ 4D mirroring
](./mirroring-data-to-another-
database/) The approach to this problem, is to have data from the source
mirror itself out to a target and accept changes from that mirror system back.
All sql based INSERT UPDATE and DELETE operations are to send their changes to
the target.

It is very important to stress this is only used for Postgres UPDATE
statements sending data back to the source. It does however provide an example
of iterating over all the fields in a table using the python dict that is
populated in ` TD["new"] ` and ` TD["old"] ` .

Limitations

  * Requires ` plpythonu ` language installed on postgres 
  * Not designed to handle ` DELETE `
  * Not designed to handle ` INSERT ` can do so with UUID (not until 4Dv12) 
  * This is a work in progress, but it is a starting point I hope 

**Iterate over table fields via python**  
You could even do a dictionary compare to find the difference between `
TD["new"] ` and ` TD["old"] ` .

    
    
    for field_name, field_value in TD["new"].items():
    	# now we have field_name and field_value to do work on
    	if field_name='alpha_field':
    		tmp=field_value
    

**Full mirroring code**  
Warning there is code here that makes the generated SQL statements 4D
compliant only. This is merely a starting point.
