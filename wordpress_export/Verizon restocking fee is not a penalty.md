# Verizon: restocking fee is not a penalty

##  Disclaimer

This has zero to do with programming, but my own story of how restocking fee
is not a penalty when returning a device.

To be fair upfront, this was my own fault because I trusted a representative
of Verizon over reading all the fine print.

##  Story

I wanted a new phone, was too lazy to go to a store and try them so I bought
one online. Before I did this I did a ‘chat online with a representative’ to
get the warm and fuzzy.

They told me ‘no problem’ if you don’t like your phone you can return it. Long
story short, I didn’t like the phone and went to return it but was told there
was a $35 restocking fee.

I know, didn’t you read anything? It is posted many places that I didn’t look,
that there is a $35 restocking fee.

So I railed against Verizon reps and got these two responses from two
different reps:

Rep 1

Rep 2

My phone conversations went no where.

##  Resolution

I filled a complaint with the BBB and within 24 hours a Verizon Wireless
corporate individual contacted me and assured me that it wasn’t misleading and
that they would refund the restocking fee so I could get a new phone.
