# Set enterable for list box object not just columns

Title says it all, I can set individual columns of a list box to be enterable
false using the property inspector, but I canâ€™t do this for the overall
listbox.

I have to either set each column to enterable false, or execute ` SET
ENTERABLE(objName;False) ` at ` On Load ` event.
