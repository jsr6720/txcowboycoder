# If you don’t know, how should I?

So my writing is rarely proof read and is likely full of errors. However I
should think there would be a way to write a script that would parse web pages
checking for errors.

Heck maybe even a HTML scrapper that took the generated content and ran it
through spell check. Sure you’d have to do it for every conceivable browser/OS
combo out there, but I would think there is a way to get to 95% or 97%
coverage.

See the example below.
