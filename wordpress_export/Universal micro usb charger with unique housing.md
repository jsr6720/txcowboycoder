# Universal micro usb charger with unique housing

Just a huge pet peeve after switching phones over the weekend. Micro USB is
supposed to be the new universal charge/data transfer male/female connector
for phones.

Great so lots of devices use micro usb for charging, but LG and Motorola use
different style encasements, making chargers incompatible even though its the
same micro usb male/female connectors.

Argh! the frustration.
