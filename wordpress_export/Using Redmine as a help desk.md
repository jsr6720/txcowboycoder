# Using Redmine as a help desk

The primary purpose of [ Redmine ](http://www.redmine.org) is a project
management tool.

However it can be used as a help desk solution with a little configuration.

The key is setting up Redmine to [ receive e-mails
](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineReceivingEmails) .

My personal approach is to set up the e-mail retrieval as IMAP. This way you
could set up a new account ` help@example.com ` and any incoming messages are
sent to a project of your designation.

See the documentation for the most up to date information. Now when a user or
anyone sends an e-mail to ` help@example.com ` a new issue with a set status
is created. Future correspondence via the issue are automatically added.
