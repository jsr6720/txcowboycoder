# Scenarios listed in Operator view are same as Designer view

I’m currently using Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) 10.1.3 and I went to clean
out the logs generated by the completed executions. I know there is a purge
logs trash can icon, but I couldn’t do this because the [ ‘UNDO’ tablespace
was full ](./error-when-purging-
log-unable-to-extend-tablespace-undo/) .

Since I was getting this error I had to remove the reports manually. Aside
from removing the reports from the “Session List” tab I also went to remove
them from the “Scenarios” tab. Thinking I would save time by removing the
entire scenario’s worth of reports I deleted the root node (see image).

What I didn’t know is removing the generated scenario from the ODI Operator
view would also remove it from the Designer view. All I had to do was go back
and regenerate the scenario from Designer view, but if your installation had
different scenarios for fall back purposes this could lead to trouble.
