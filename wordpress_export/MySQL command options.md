# MySQL command options

So I use MySQL for testing from time to time and I always get frustrated at
logging in via command line.

Is it option “P” or option “p”, “U” or “u”. Long story short I chuckled at the
option for -U or ` --i-am-a-dummy ` . So if you can’t figure out how to log
in, maybe you are just a dummy like myself.

Which itself is apparently is a synonym for option ` --safe-updates `
