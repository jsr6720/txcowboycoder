# Redmine versus Request Tracker

A comparison of [ Request Tracker ](http://bestpractical.com/rt/) version
3.8.4 to [ Redmine ](http://www.redmine.org) version [ 1.0.4
](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/versions/26) .

This evaluation preceded scripting a [ migration
](https://github.com/jsr6720/Request-Tracker-to-Redmine-Migration) between the
two systems.

##  Introduction

This targets the general features in Redmine vs. Request Tracker and is not a
comparison of custom variables, or configuration options. This is not an
exhaustive list; this was written as a simple comparison of basic issue
tracking features between Request Tracker 3.8.4 and Redmine 1.0.4.

##  Features unique to Redmine

###  More than just a ticket tracking system

Request Tracker excels at one thing, ticket tracking. Redmine is an [ issue
tracking system
](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/RedmineIssueTrackingSetup) and has
additional modules available.

  * Time tracking 
  * News 
  * Documents 
  * Files 
  * Wiki 
  * Repository 
  * Forums 

##  Features unique to Request Tracker

###  Reply to closed ticket re-opens it

In redmine replying to a ticket does not change the status.

###  Outgoing e-mails stored

Request Tracker tickets show an entire chain of events, including all
automated e-mails with full headers. In experience, occasionally useful.

###  Comment vs. Reply to requester

Request Tracker has a concept of replying to requester and making comments on
an issue. Redmine will send update e-mails for every comment, regardless of
content.  
There is an open feature request for [ private comments
](http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554) that addresses this issue.

[ Redmine Stealth Plugin
](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/PluginRedmineStealth) to temporarily
disable notifications on actions taken by a user.  
It is ajax based, so if I wanted to make a comment on an issue that sent no
notifications; I would click the **Enable Stealth Mode** link, take my
actions, then **Disable Stealth Mode** after I’m done.  
Again this is user based, so it does not affect other actions taken by other
users.

There is an open request on Redmine for functionality similar to this:  
[ http://www.redmine.org/issues/6229 ](http://www.redmine.org/issues/6229)

###  Ticket Requester

One of the more advanced features of Request Tracker was the **People**
section. Request Tracker stored who created the ticket, who owned the ticket,
and requesters of the ticket. Created is a searchable, but essentially hidden
attribute of a Request Tracker ticket.  
This allowed Request Tracker users to create a ticket for a user, and assign
them as the requester. This is not possible in Redmine.

Redmine only stores Author (Request Tracker – creator). The only way to get an
issue created with the proper author is for that person to create it via
e-mail or by logging in.

Open feature request to change that:  
[ http://www.redmine.org/issues/2035 ](http://www.redmine.org/issues/2035)

###  Merge Tickets

In Request Tracker when a ticket was merged with another, only one ticket
existed at the end of the process. The original ticket number would point to
the ticket it was merged into, and the content from the merging ticket would
appear in the merged ticket.

This was useful for joining several e-mails that were related to one ticket.

In Redmine you can only link related tickets by adding a **duplicates** or
**duplicated by** related issue. This will only establish a link between the
two issues, not copy content from one to another.

Also, there is a standing practice to find the duplicate ticket and close it,
so time/comments/updates are logged against one issue.

There are a few standing feature request for this functionality

  * [ http://www.redmine.org/issues/1624 ](http://www.redmine.org/issues/1624)
  * [ http://www.redmine.org/issues/3708 ](http://www.redmine.org/issues/3708)

To accomplish the same concept as Request Tracker “merge” mark multiple
Redmine issues **duplicates** and update the most recent ticket as the
“active” one.

###  Reminders

In Request Tracker you could attach reminders to tickets that would show up on
your main page. Reminders could have a date and subject. There is no concept
of this in Redmine.

At best comments can be made against an issue, or watch an issue.

**NOTE** reminders live in the tickets table as rt3.tickets.type = ‘reminder’
so they could be converted as pseudo tickets if needed, related to the
attached ticket.

###  Ticket Status ‘delete’

In Request Tracker tickets could not be deleted. A status of ‘delete’ only
meant the ticket was hidden from the gui, but can still be accessed via direct
ticket number input, and still existed in the database.

##  Conclusion

For just issue tracking, both systems offer lots of features. However for me
Redmine takes the cake with the larger feature set of project management.
