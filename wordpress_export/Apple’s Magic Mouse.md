# Apple’s Magic Mouse

First, I like the small form factor, and tracking is very accurate.

My favorite features: not having to ‘know’ where the tracking wheel is, swipes
for going back and forth in safari (very helpful for documentation
navigation).

My point of confusion: the mouse says it does not require any additional
installation media, however once you pair the device with your computer, thats
not all to it. Additional components have to be downloaded via Apple Software
update.

Now this could be because I’m on 10.5.8 instead of 10.6.x but it was a short
point of ‘huh?’ that could have been clarified with a simple “Run automatic
update when pairing is complete”.

I also like not having to plug in a USB pairing device, and it shipped with
batteries in it.

All in all, it’s a keeper.
