# What’s in a name?

I’m here cracking into the crowed field of programming blogs. Maybe I’ll learn
to write more concisely, or even improve my spelling.

Though mainly, I thought I would start something that I could collect my
thoughts on problems that I have found a solution to.

Other times I might just post something unrelated to programming for
conversation’s sake.

What’s in a name? I currently work in an environment where bugs and problems
crop up like bad guys in [ High Noon ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044706/
"High Noon") . Even if one day I work in a different environment, cowboy
coding to me is some of the most exciting and frustrating work with
programming.

Whether it’s looking a new languages or exploring different tools, every
problem could benefit from a revolver full of ideas emptied at it.

So saddle up and ride into the west, for there are countless problems to be
solved and bounty to be had.
