# Joined Github

As I worked on some code for an open source project I wanted to learn Git for
a variety of reasons.

So not only am I using it, but I also joined [ Github
](https://github.com/jsr6720/)

I am definitely a fan of the distributed nature of Git, and I love the error
messages, very helpful. Thank you git for suggesting a common fix to probably
a common problem.

    
    
    $ git add
    Nothing specified, nothing added.
    Maybe you wanted to say 'git add .'?

    $ svn add
    svn: Try 'svn help' for more info
    svn: Not enough arguments provided
