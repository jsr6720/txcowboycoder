# 4D Forms to have layers instead of limited number of ‘views’

I would love it if 4D could mimic the dynamic layer system that Adobe uses.

###  4D Views

4D v11 has a limit of 9 ‘views’ per form. Views are great for swapping out
elements in the same area and making it easier to target a collection of
related objects.

With more complex forms, I’ve wanted more views than the maximum number
allowed. I could use the pages feature of forms, but then I’d have to manage
the current page programmatically. Besides views/layers are a design concept
and pages are more to control data display.

The following are examples from Flash and InDesign. There are no conceivable
limits to the number of layers in the Adobe suite. A small preview pane would
be nice too, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.

###  Adobe Layers

I’m a big fan of the color knock-outs that make it really easy to find that
layer’s objects in the project.
