# WordPress engine fail on embeded smilies in source

So I went to post a source code snippet and kept getting this

    
    
    <img src="http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif?m=1268811515g" alt=":o" class="wp-smiley">
    

Whenever I had ` :o ` in my examples. Say for a ruby on rails ` :order `
example.

Turns out [ smilies ](http://en.support.wordpress.com/smilies/) can be
disabled blog wide. I would just expect wordpress to not parse ‘smilies’ in my
` sourcecode ` blocks.
