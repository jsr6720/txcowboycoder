# Method editor search with wrap option

Can’t tell you how annoying it is that search in a method editor can only go
forwards or backwards of the cursor.

On larger methods (greater than 80 lines) I’ve done searches for words
thinking they’re not in that method because I forgot to position my cursor at
the top or do a forwards and backwards search.

See my [ feature request ](http://forums.4d.fr/Post//4688233/1/) for this on
4D forums.
