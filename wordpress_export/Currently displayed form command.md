# Currently displayed form command

A command ` Currently displayed form ` would return a text string of whatever
form is set by ` INPUT FORM ` or ` DIALOG ` and is currently displayed.

[ 4D feature request ](http://forums.4d.fr/Post//4641149/1/)

This would help determine what the user is looking at during troubleshooting.
Also the table name and form name could be passed to ` GET FORM PROPERTIES `
for even more information.

But without knowing which form (project or table) the user has up issue triage
generally involves asking the user ‘what were you doing at the time of
error?’.

Yes I am aware of ` WINDOW LIST ` and ` Current form table ` commands, neither
gets the answer of what table or project form is currently displayed.
